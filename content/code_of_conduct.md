The ```#lowtech``` code of conduct is:

1. Don't post spoilers
* Don't dox others
* Don't defend ideas that are stupid
* Do mark nsfw links with 'nsfw'
* Do post links to good music
* Do come with a thick skin
* There is no escape from synthwave
* Anyone who forms a committee shall be code of conducted to death

Suggestions for additions, changes, removals, complaints, and general hand-wringing must be directed in writing to the ```#lowtech``` channel on Freenode IRC with an associated pull request to the [GitHub website repository](https://github.com/davidpirogov/lowtech.io)
